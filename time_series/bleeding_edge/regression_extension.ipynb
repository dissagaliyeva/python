    "Stationary data means that its statistical properties do not vary with time. There are 5 forms:\n",
    "- Strict / strong stationary: no changes even if shifted\n",
    "- first-order stationary: constant mean\n",
    "- weak (second-order) stationary: mean, variance and covariance are constant throughout the series\n",
    "- trend stationary: varies around the trends (statistical mean property varies), can be linear or quadric\n",
