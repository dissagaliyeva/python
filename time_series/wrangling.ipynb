    "The following problems are common when working with time-series data:\n",
    "- missing data\n",
    "- changing the frequency of a time series (upsampling & downsampling)\n",
    "- smoothing data\n",
    "- addressing seasonality in data\n",
    "- preventing unintentional lookaheads\n",

    "### Handling missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very common to have missing data. Several aspects of it in the medical field can be:\n",
    "- The patient didn’t comply with a desired measurement.\n",
    "- The patient’s health stats were in good shape, so there was no need to take a particular measurement.\n",
    "- The patient was forgotten or undertreated.\n",
    "- A medical device had a random technical malfunction.\n",
    "- There was a data entry error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions can be:\n",
    "- Imputation\n",
    "When we fill in missing data based on observations about the entire data set.\n",
    "- Interpolation\n",
    "When we use neighboring data points to estimate the missing value. Interpolation can also be a form of imputation.\n",
    "- Deletion of affected time periods\n",
    "When we choose not to use time periods that have missing data at all."
